## What is this?

This is a set of Python scripts to help players who play the mobile rhythm game [Love Live School Idol Festival](http://www.school-fes.klabgames.net).
Love Live School Idol Festival (SIF) is a free-to-play (with in-app purchases) rhythm and card collection game available for iOS and Android
and is based on the [Love Live!](http://www.lovelive-anime.jp/worldwide/) media franchise.

## How do I use it?

You will need the [Python](https://www.python.org) scripting language installed on your machine.

If you are on a Mac or a Linux machine, you almost certainly already have this. To check, run the command `python -V` at a shell prompt. If you get back something like `Python 2.7.10` then you do. If instead you see `command not found` then you will need to install Python. For Linux users, it is probably available in your distribution's package manager; for RedHat based systems (RedHat, CentOS, Fedora) try `sudo yum install python` and for Debian based distros (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint) try `sudo apt-get install python`. Mac users can install Python using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh); once Homebrew is installed, issue the command `brew install python` If you are on a Windows computer, you can download [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) from the Python website.
